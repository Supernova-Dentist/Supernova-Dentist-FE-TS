      'I am not a great patient when it comes to the dentist. But I have found my experience at Supernova so far to be fabulous. The team there were very friendly and professional putting me at ease straight away. Scott has made me feel much more confident in visiting the dentist, and has been fantastic.',

      "Being a very nervous patient I can't praise Scott and the nursing team highly enough. I never thought I would say it but I no longer dread a trip to the dentist. The appointments have always been pain free and I am made aware of what is being done. Well done to you all.",
