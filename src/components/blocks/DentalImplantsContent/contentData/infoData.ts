  descriptions: [
    'Dental implants are a modern solution for replacing missing teeth. They consist of a titanium post that is surgically inserted into the jawbone, which acts as a replacement root for a new tooth. This procedure provides a stable and durable foundation for attaching crowns, bridges, or dentures.',
    'Implants offer a natural look and feel, effectively restoring both the function and aesthetics of your smile. They can be used to replace a single tooth, multiple teeth, or even support full dentures. Our expert team ensures a precise and comfortable procedure with long-lasting results.',
