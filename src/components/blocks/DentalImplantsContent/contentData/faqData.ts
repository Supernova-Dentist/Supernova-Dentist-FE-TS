    question: 'What are dental implants and how do they compare to other options?',
    answer:
      'Dental implants are a permanent solution for missing teeth, consisting of a titanium post fused to your jawbone and topped with a custom crown. They offer superior stability, natural appearance and durability compared to dentures or bridges. Unlike dentures, implants are fixed and don’t require adhesives. They also preserve adjacent teeth and jawbone health, unlike bridges that rely on neighboring teeth for support.',
