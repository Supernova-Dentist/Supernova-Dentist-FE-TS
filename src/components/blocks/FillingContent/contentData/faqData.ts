    question: 'Question: What is involved in a dental filling procedure?',
    answer:
      'Answer: At our dental practice, a dental filling involves a few key steps. First, we’ll examine the affected tooth and clean out any decay. Then, we’ll fill the cavity with a material that suits your needs, whether it’s composite resin, amalgam, or another option. Finally, we’ll shape the filling to match the natural contours of your tooth and ensure a comfortable bite. Our goal is to restore your tooth’s function and appearance while preventing further decay.',

During your visit, our dentist will conduct a thorough examination and may take X-rays to assess the extent of any damage.

    question: 'Question: How long do dental fillings last?',
    answer:
      'Answer: The longevity of a dental filling depends on the material used and how well you care for your teeth. Composite fillings generally last 5-7 years, while amalgam fillings can last 10-15 years or more. Regular dental checkups and good oral hygiene are key to maximizing the lifespan of your fillings. We’ll monitor the condition of your fillings during your routine visits and recommend replacements if needed.',

    question: 'Question: Can I eat normally after getting a dental filling?',
    answer:
      'Answer: You can usually resume normal eating and drinking after a dental filling, but we recommend avoiding hard or sticky foods for the first 24 hours. If your filling was placed in a back tooth, it might take a bit longer to get used to the new filling. If you have any concerns or experience any issues with your filling, please reach out to our office for guidance.',
