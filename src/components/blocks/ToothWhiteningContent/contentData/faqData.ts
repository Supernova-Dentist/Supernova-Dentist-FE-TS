    question: 'What is tooth whitening?',
    answer:
      'Tooth whitening is a cosmetic dental treatment that lightens your teeth and removes stains caused by food, drinks, or aging. At Supernova Dental, we offer professional in-office teeth whitening for fast, dramatic results and take-home whitening kits for a more gradual but effective solution.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does in-office whitening compare to at-home kits?',
    answer:
      'In-office whitening at Supernova Dental provides faster and more noticeable results with professional-grade whitening agents and advanced technology. At-home kits are more gradual but still effective, using custom trays and less concentrated agents to safely brighten your smile over time.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Why choose professional whitening at Supernova Dental?',
    answer:
      'Professional whitening treatments at Supernova Dental are tailored to your needs and offer deeper, longer-lasting results compared to over-the-counter whitening toothpaste, which only helps remove surface stains. With our professional treatments, you can achieve a brighter, more lasting smile.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long do whitening results last?',
    answer:
      'In-office whitening at Supernova Dental can last 1-2 years with proper care, while at-home whitening treatments typically last 6-12 months. To maintain your results, practice good oral hygiene and avoid staining foods and drinks like coffee, tea and red wine.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is whitening safe for everyone?',
    answer:
      'Teeth whitening is safe for most people, but it may not be suitable for pregnant or breastfeeding women or individuals with certain dental conditions such as gum disease or tooth decay. Our dental team at Supernova Dental will assess your oral health and recommend the best whitening option for you.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can whitening be done on crowns or fillings?',
    answer:
      'Teeth whitening only works on natural tooth enamel and will not affect crowns, fillings, or other dental restorations. If your restorations are discolored, we may recommend replacing them after whitening to match the new color of your teeth for a consistent, natural look.',
