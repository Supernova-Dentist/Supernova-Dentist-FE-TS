            At our practice, we take all complaints seriously and strive to ensure that every patient is satisfied with
            their experience. When a complaint is made, we handle it promptly and courteously, aiming to resolve the
            matter as quickly as possible. Our procedure is guided by these core principles.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our goal is to respond to complaints in a manner that reflects how we would want our own concerns to be
            addressed.
          </p>

          <p>
            The <strong>Practice Manager</strong> is responsible for handling any complaints regarding our services. If
            the Practice Manager is unavailable, the practice owners will step in to address the issue. In cases where
            the complaint involves the Practice Manager directly, it will be managed by the practice owners as well.
