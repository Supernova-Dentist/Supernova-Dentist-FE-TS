    question: 'What is tooth whitening?',
    answer:
      'Tooth whitening is a cosmetic dental procedure aimed at lightening the color of your teeth and removing stains. We offer several whitening options including in-office treatments, take-home kits, and over-the-counter products. Our in-office treatments provide the fastest and most dramatic results, while take-home kits offer convenience and gradual whitening.',

  {
    question: 'How does in-office whitening compare to at-home whitening?',
    answer:
      'In-office whitening is a professional treatment that uses stronger bleaching agents and advanced technology for quicker, more noticeable results—typically achieved in just one visit. At-home whitening involves custom-fitted trays and a lower concentration of bleaching agents, which may require a few weeks to achieve the desired results. Both methods are effective, but in-office whitening is ideal for faster, more dramatic results.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What are the benefits of professional whitening over whitening toothpaste?',
    answer:
      'Professional whitening treatments, whether in-office or at-home, provide a more significant and lasting whitening effect compared to whitening toothpaste. While toothpaste can help maintain the whiteness of your teeth and remove surface stains, it cannot penetrate deeper stains or offer the same level of whitening. Professional treatments are tailored to your needs and can deliver visible results more efficiently.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long do the results of tooth whitening last?',
    answer:
      'The longevity of tooth whitening results depends on the method used and your lifestyle. In-office whitening results typically last 1-2 years with proper care, while at-home treatments can last about 6-12 months. Whitening toothpaste helps maintain results, but avoiding foods and drinks that cause staining, such as coffee and red wine, will also extend the effects.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is tooth whitening safe for everyone?',
    answer:
      'Tooth whitening is generally safe for most people. However, it is not recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women and individuals with certain dental conditions. We will assess your oral health and determine the best whitening option for you. If you have sensitive teeth or gums, we can customize the treatment to minimize discomfort.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How should I care for my teeth after whitening?',
    answer:
      'After whitening, maintain good oral hygiene by brushing twice a day, flossing daily, and avoiding foods and drinks that can stain your teeth. Regular dental check-ups and cleanings will help keep your teeth bright and healthy. We also recommend using a whitening toothpaste to help prolong the results.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the difference between in-office whitening and over-the-counter whitening products?',
    answer:
      'In-office whitening treatments use professional-grade whitening agents and advanced techniques to achieve faster and more dramatic results. Over-the-counter products, such as strips or gels, are less potent and may take longer to show results. In-office treatments are also supervised by our dental team, ensuring safety and effectiveness.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much does tooth whitening cost?',
    answer:
      'The cost of tooth whitening varies depending on the type of treatment. In-office whitening typically ranges from £300 to £600, while take-home whitening kits are generally priced between £100 and £300. Over-the-counter products are more affordable, but often less effective. Contact us for a personalized quote based on your needs and treatment preferences.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can tooth whitening be done on crowns or fillings?',
    answer:
      'Tooth whitening only works on natural tooth enamel and will not affect crowns, fillings, or other dental restorations. If you have restorations that are discolored or need to match your newly whitened teeth, we may recommend replacing them after your whitening treatment to ensure a consistent appearance.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is tooth whitening covered by insurance?',
    answer:
      'Tooth whitening is generally considered a cosmetic procedure and may not be covered by dental insurance. However, if whitening is needed for restorative purposes or part of a larger dental treatment plan, there might be partial coverage. Check with your insurance provider for specific details regarding your coverage.',
